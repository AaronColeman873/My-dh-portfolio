<h1>Responses to Anatomy of an AI System </h1>
<p>The Anatomy of an AI System, made me think about how complex and far-reaching artificial intelligence actually is. The article shows how it is connected to physical labor, data extraction, and environmental impact all over the world. It made me think more about the hidden costs behind the convenience of modern technology and how AI isn’t just virtual, but deeply tied to real world systems.</p>
<h1>Principles within a contract for the web.</h1>
<p>Principle 5 relates to companies building people's trust online. To build trust online, companies should respect and protect people’s privacy and give users control over their personal data. People should get clear info about how their data is used, be able to easily manage their privacy settings, and be able to take their data with them in usable formats. Businesses should be held accountable by doing regular privacy checks, collecting only the necessary data, and designing apps and websites in ways that protect users’ data and respect their choices. Everyone should have access to privacy-friendly options online. Companies should also clearly explain their privacy policies, make it easy to report problems, and keep users updated on changes that affect their data.

Principle 8 relates to people building strong communities that respect civil discourse and human dignity. To create strong online communities where everyone feels safe and respected, we need to make the internet more inclusive by encouraging respectful and civil conversations, and support and amplify voices of groups that are often excluded or targeted. We must also protect our own and others’ privacy by choosing products carefully and setting privacy preferences, and avoid sharing private or intimate info about others without their consent.

Both these principles tell us to make sure thst we respect people's privacy when online</p>
