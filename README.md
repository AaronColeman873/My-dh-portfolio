<h1>Responses to Anatomy of an AI System </h1>
<p>The Anatomy of an AI System, made me think about how complex and far-reaching artificial intelligence actually is. The article shows how it is connected to physical labor, data extraction, and environmental impact all over the world. It made me think more about the hidden costs behind the convenience of modern technology and how AI isn’t just virtual, but deeply tied to real world systems.</p>

<h1>Responses to The Internet's Own Boy</h1>
<p>According to the movie The Internet's Own Boy, knowledge is created and shared by powerful corporations and governments. I agree with this for multiple reasons, some being what we are able to see and what happens if we try to see things in ways we are not allowed to. My first reason is things we are able to see. In the movie there were millions of JSTOR articles behind a paywall. This restricts who the knowledge can be shared to as the corporations only share it with people able to pay for it can view it. My second reason is what happens if we try to see things in ways we are not allowed to. In the movie Aaron downloads these articles in the hopes of sharing them to everyone for free. This results in him being charged with 35 years in prison. This shows how the government are okay with the underprivileged people not getting the knowledge.
I believe that everyone should have the right to view an article of information without being stopped by a paywall.</p>

<h1>Principles within a contract for the web.</h1>
<p>Principle 5 relates to companies building people's trust online. To build trust online, companies should respect and protect people’s privacy and give users control over their personal data. People should get clear info about how their data is used, be able to easily manage their privacy settings, and be able to take their data with them in usable formats. Businesses should be held accountable by doing regular privacy checks, collecting only the necessary data, and designing apps and websites in ways that protect users’ data and respect their choices. Everyone should have access to privacy-friendly options online. Companies should also clearly explain their privacy policies, make it easy to report problems, and keep users updated on changes that affect their data.
Principle 8 relates to people building strong communities that respect civil discourse and human dignity. To create strong online communities where everyone feels safe and respected, we need to make the internet more inclusive by encouraging respectful and civil conversations, and support and amplify voices of groups that are often excluded or targeted. We must also protect our own and others’ privacy by choosing products carefully and setting privacy preferences, and avoid sharing private or intimate info about others without their consent.
Both these principles tell us to make sure thst we respect people's privacy when online</p>

<h1>Should all archives be Open Access?</h1>
<p>I think the first main point is that archives have shifted from closed, static institutions to open, digital spaces, raising new challenges. Traditionally, archives were seen as fixed “repositories” where researchers accessed documents under controlled conditions. With the rise of the Open Access Movement and digital technology, archives are now expected to make information freely available online. However, this shift toward openness has created complex ethical and legal questions about privacy, accuracy, and public access.
I think the second main point is that the balance between public right to know and personal privacy is increasingly difficult. Open data laws and freedom of information acts have expanded access to government and historical records, but they also expose sensitive personal information. The “right to be forgotten” and privacy laws like the EU’s GDPR show how individuals want control over their digital identities, while historians and archivists worry that erasing names or redacting documents threatens the integrity of history. Archives must constantly balance transparency with the duty to protect private individuals.
I think that the third main point is that digital technology complicates authenticity, context, and trust in archives. Digitization and data sharing make archival materials easier to access, but also easier to distort, decontextualize, or misuse. Once documents are online, they can be copied, altered, or linked with other datasets in unpredictable ways. Archivists must preserve the authenticity of records while managing privacy risks and respecting contextual integrity, the idea that how information is shared should depend on its social and historical context.</p>
<h1>The Dangers of Stochastic Parrots</h1>
<p>I believe the coming revolution holds a big risk such as environmental risks, financial risks, and the risk of substantial harm. Applications that aim to believably mimic humans bring risk of extreme harms. Work on synthetic human behavior is a bright line in ethical AI development, where downstream effects need to be understood and modeled in order to block foreseeable harm to society and different social groups.</p>
